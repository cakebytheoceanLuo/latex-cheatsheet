\section{Chap2 EXTERNAL DATA REPRESENTATION} in OSI Presentation Layer
\subsection*{Heterogeneity}
HW: Diff. HW architectures store bytes:Big Small Endian
ProgrammingLanguage:Diff. PL store data types differently:AB, 0AB \\
\textbf{Transformation between representations}: Transformation between local and remote representations|Information may lost
\\Two realizations:
$1.$\textbf{Pairwise transformation between $n$ local representations}(vollst√§ndigGraph,$\#n^2 - n$, Either sender or receiver has to transform) 
$2.$\textbf{Transformation to and from canonical representation}(a single canonical $C$ as intermediate representation|No local information about communication
partner needed| $\#2*(n-2)$, $ -2$if canonical is one of $n$)
