# Template for a very compact LaTeX Cheat Sheet

In this repo you will find some Cheat Sheet, that I brought to my exam, in which we could bring our single  digital printed A4 paper. So I decided to use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX"/> to build these Cheat Sheet.

This repo is based on [the forked repo](https://github.com/tim-st/latex-cheatsheet).

Hope you could enjoy that!
